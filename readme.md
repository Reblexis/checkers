Evaluation strategy:

- keep your pawns near middle
- move pawns from the single corner first and from the double corner only when neccessary
- very good to have  pawn on the square (4, 3) numbering from top left topdown, leftright
- attack the double corner of the opponent
- keep 3 backline checks in their starting pos as long as possible to prevent king creation
- also keep the checkers (8,3) and (8,7) on their square
- get king as fast as possible
- set traps to get double / triple shots ?
- if up by one or more than trade checkers
- form lines of three or more checkers
